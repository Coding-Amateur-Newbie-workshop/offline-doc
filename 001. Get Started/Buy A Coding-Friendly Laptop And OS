# Buy A Coding-Friendly Laptop And OS

## Overview

First of all, let's make it clear for our essential goals to become a beginner-level coder.

Suppose your goals are :

* Learn visual programming language [Scratch](scratch.mit.edu/)
* Then, furthermore, learn a popular programming language [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* Because both Scratch and Python are [Turing-Complete programming languages](https://developer.aliyun.com/article/764371), which means that you can use them to implement the same basic program (in fact, for their different purposes, Scratch aims to offer an educational visual programming language to coding amateurs, Python is a generally purposefully industrial programming language that can do many different things)
* While practicing coding or programming, you gain the knowledge of daily use of computer operating system (OS)
* Either Scratch or Python is in the scope of the exam of 
* By learning programming, it benefits and inspires your understanding of mathematic course, English course, logical thinking troubleshooting, analytical thinking and so on
* Potentially open up a future to be a professional coder/developer/engineer into this industry



## Choose Your Laptop

### Mac Book

Mac Book is the laptop developed by [Apple Inc](https://www.apple.com/mac/). Its latest architecture [M2](https://www.imore.com/m2-macbook-pro-2022) is deemed to be the extremely powerful CPU architecture that enables Mac Book to perform excellently in many circumstances.

For the need to begin some tiny coding to learn coding itself, I recommend that CPU may not play a very important role in coding simple programs. Instead, if you are developing a large-scale game, 3D design, movie, scientist simulation, an excellent CPU plays crucial role for those cases.

On the other hand, lots of memory (RAM) is preferable because programs are loaded into RAM to be execute. 32GB RAM fits the present and future need, however the total cost for an Apple Mac Book is tremendous. By considering that a coding beginner mostly writes a simple code, 16GB RAM can be a backup plan. This spec is sufficient for the current usage.



Pros :

* Consistent excellent quality
* Graphical capability
* Integrity of hardware and software

Cons :

* All the models are expensive



### PC

PC is the architecture started by IBM originally. Normally the CPU architecture is designed by Intel or AMD. Thanks to the PC production is mostly assembled largely by our own country - China. In addition, because the PC has dominated the personal computer market for long time, there are lots of competitors and lots of Chinese producers making PC.

Therefore,  the range of prices can be from low and high. Furthermore, the model to choice also ranges from entry level to professional level, unlike Mac of Apple, which is powerful and expensive but you have no other cheaper choice

Similar to Mac, CPU doesn't play crucial role so Intel i5 or AMD something fits most of your scenarios of learning entry-level coding. The good news is that you have more funds to spend on memory (RAM). The logic is the same, if you can afford 32GB RAM is the mainstream, whereas 16GB RAM is sufficient for now.



Pros:

* Wide range of models
* Wide range of prices

Cons

* Apple's M2 CPU architecture overwhelms Intel and AMD now
* The quality is not guaranteed since PC producers techniques are different
* Hardware and software (Windows) has integration impediment 



## Choose Your Operating System

[Operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) is a system software that manges hardware, software resources and provides common services (aka API) for computer programs. In terms of computer architecture, OS stays in between hardware and computer programs which are used by human users. It's a complicated and vital system software in general.

Recently the major 3 operating systems in the personal computer worlds are Apple OSX, Windows 11 or other version, Linux and its many distributions. 

Widely speaking, beyond personal computer, likewise mainframe, airplane, automatic control and so on, they have their dedicated OS. Simply put, in mobile world, there are two famous OS, iOS and Android are also operating systems. Although they are actually branches stemmed from [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix). 



### Apple OSX

Apple OSX is stemmed from the original Unix.
